# Universal Dotfiles
All the configuration files within this directory will work on both macOS and Debian-based GNU/Linux distributions. They are very minimal configurations being under 100 lines of code and are all very easy to understand.

## Installing
I have written a script that will configure everything for you. For this script to work it must be downloaded to your home directory and run from your home directory. Make sure you understand what this script will do before running it.

You can find the install script here:
