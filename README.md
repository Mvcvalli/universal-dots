# Universal Dotfiles
All the configuration files within this directory will work on macOS and GNU/Linux. They are very minimal configuration being under 100 lines of code and are very easy to understand.

## Installing 
If you are using macOS or a Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution I have written a script that will configure everything for you. For this script to work it must be downloaded to your home directory and run from your home directory. [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mvcvalli/universal-dots/main/install.sh][You can find the install script here.]]
